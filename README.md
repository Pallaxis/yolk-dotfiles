# Yolk configured dotfiles

all are stored in the eggs directory & yolk.rhai configures what goes where, as well as whether to put or merge those files

## Why yolk over stow?

yolk allows me to create template files that will apply based on hostname, but keeps a consistent file to track with git right before committing, no matter what machine i'm on
